#'Strings and Lists' problem from ROSALIND
#Given: A string s of length at most 200 letters and four integers a, b, c and d
#Return: The slice of this string from indices a through b and c through d (with space in between), inclusively. In other words, we should include elements s[b] and s[d] in our slice

#Define variables
a=34
b=45
c=126
d=136
#Define string
jingle = 'LrUJelh6KivKqnNcwCL1et92Nrpawea0m8NatriciteresVtiwb83J5SNfWBVHCPad7zIDuOerzsfP6cnlhLPRXKXlStdz4S7uBp9zLK7mDIj7gjAPsWao7yPePFwQbicoloratumOJB5JhSdm7292SQPjCS8VMzVd8gm'
#Pull required items out of list and add a space 
e=jingle[a:b+1] + ' ' + jingle[c:d+1]
#Print string slice
print e
