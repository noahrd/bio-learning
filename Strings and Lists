#'Strings and Lists' problem from ROSALIND
#Given: A string s of length at most 200 letters and four integers a, b, c and d
#Return: The slice of this string from indices a through b and c through d (with space in between), inclusively. In other words, we should include elements s[b] and s[d] in our slice

#Define variables
a=22
b=27
c=97
d=102
#Define string
jingle = 'HumptyDumptysatonawallHumptyDumptyhadagreatfallAlltheKingshorsesandalltheKingsmenCouldntputHumptyDumptyinhisplaceagain'
#Pull required items out of list and add a space 
e=jingle[a:b+1] + ' ' + jingle[c:d+1]
#Print string slice
print e
