#'Working with Files' problem from ROSALIND

#Given:A file containing at most 1000 lines.
#Return:A file containing all the even-numbered lines from the original file. Assume 1-based numbering of lines.

#Define the target lines
evens=[]
#Open file and retrieve target lines
a=open('sample.txt','r')
with open('sample.txt') as myFile:
    for num,line in enumerate(myFile):
        if num %2==1:
            evens.append(line)
#Print target lines
print evens
#close file
a.close()
